# Agent-Based-Model

In Agent-Based Modeling, Discrete Evolution is used to model how agents evolve over time, while Social Dynamics is used to model the specific types of interactions and behaviors that emerge from those evolutions. This project uses discrete evolution and social dynamics to model coplex systems.
